// __________________________ VARIABLES __________________________________ // 

let character = 'luigi';

// __________________________ ARRAYS __________________________________ // 

let names = ['luigi', 'mario', 'vesna']; 

names.push('toad') // will work because we are pushing a string into a string arr 

// names.push(10) won't work because it's a number

//names = 'something' won't work because name was declared as an array, can't be transformed into a string

let mixed = ['mario', 9, 'luigi', 10]; 

mixed.push('ryu') // will work because mixed it's an array of strings and numbers

mixed.push(20) // will work because mixed it's an array of strings and numbers

mixed[0] = 3 // will work even though position 1 of mixed is a string because mixed is formed of numbers and strings

// mixed.push(true) won't work because boolean hasn't been declared at the begining

// __________________________ OBJECTS __________________________________ // 

let ninja = {

    age: 30
}

ninja.age = 40; //will work because age is defined as a number 

//ninja.skills = ['fighting', 'dancing'] won't work because we haven't declared at the begining an array of skills inside ninja. once the object is defined, additional properties can't be added

ninja = {
    name: 'yoshi', 
    belt: 'orange',
    age: 40,
    // skills = ['fighthing', 'dancing'] won't work because initially the array wasn't containing skills. Typescript is very strict with this
}

// ______________________ EXPLICIT TYPES ______________________________ // 

let person: string; // we declare a variable but we don't give a value to it. also, we are telling typescript that when the value will be added, it should be a string 

let howOld: number; 

// howOld = 'luigi' won't work because we set the type of howOld to number;

let fighters: string[] = []; //this tells typescript we are creating an array of strings and it is initialized as an empty array. this let's us do fighters.push['ryu'] without error


// ______________________ UNION TYPES ______________________________ //

let combined: (string|number)[] = []; //this tells typescript we are creating an array of strings or numbers and it is initialized as an empty array. this let's us do fighters.push['ryu'] without error

combined.push('ryu') // will work 
combined.push(10) // will work
// mixed.push[true] won't work because boolean hasn't been declared

let uid: string|number; 

uid = '123' // will work 
uid = 123 // will work


let ninjaOne: object;

} 

// this still works

let ninjaTwo : {

//here we say ninjaTwo is an object and has to have those three types inside without declaring them at the beginning
